learnng github setup and utility
After years in the web development world learning html, css, php and jquery, I have in recent months taking the tentative step into developing cml programming, developed my understanding of windows cmd, SSH (putty) and stepped into the 'git world'. The idea is to optimize my use of pre-packaged modules and application and also cut down time spent in web pages review by referring to 'master' copies in repostory and only updating branches. More importantly by learning to 'pull requests' from pre-developed packages for upgrading or modification. Having worked with drupal CMS predominantly, I have often shyed away from using drush (drupal secure shell cml). With increasing confidence using composer, its now time to take that dive into git and improve my understanding of drush. Promises to be fun.
